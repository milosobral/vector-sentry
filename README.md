# VectorSentry  

**VectorSentry** is a Go library designed to monitor and manage diverse resources, integrating their data into a vector database. It provides a seamless way to track changes in resources like text files, PDF files (with OCR), websites, and RSS feeds, ensuring the vector database stays up-to-date as resources evolve.  

## Features  
- **Unified Resource Management**: Handles text files, PDFs, websites, and RSS feeds.  
- **Change Detection**: Monitors resources for updates in real-time.  
- **Vector Database Integration**: Adds and updates resource data efficiently in a vector database.  
- **Scalable Worker Pool**: Processes resource events using a fixed number of threads for optimal performance.  

## Use Cases  
- **Search and Recommendation Engines**: Keep embeddings updated for better results.  
- **Knowledge Bases**: Maintain up-to-date embeddings of documents and feeds.  
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger actions when resources are modified.  

## Roadmap  
[] Implement basic functionality with text files and RSS feeds
[] Add Docker code for easy deployment
[] Add support for PDFs
[] Add support for websites
